   <h3> Absolute link - </h3>

    (a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about"> --click me --< )
     <p>(Links to pages on other websites on the internet
        are called absolute links. 
       A typical absolute link will be made up of the
        following parts: protocol://domain/path. An absolute link will always 
       contain the protocol and domain of the destination.  </p>
   
    <h3>Relative link -</h3>
      <a href="./PAGES/about.html">--About--</a>
      (href="./Pages/about.html">--About--)
    <p> (Links to other pages within our own website are called relative links. 
        Relative links do not include the domain name, since it is another page 
        on the same site, it assumes the domain name will be the same as the page 
        we created the link on.
        Relative links only include the file path to the other page, relative to the 
        page you are creating the link on)  </p>

   <h2>Here's a quick overview of what I've learned so far.</h2>
   <br/>
   <ul>
     <li>
        You can create a folder in your terminal and add files to it via/vs code. 
     </li>
    <li>
        All code has a standard <i>boilerpoint</i>, (the standard code for all html).
        <br/><i> i.e. < ! Doctype html >
        <br/> < html lang = "en" >
        <br/>< head >,< meta charset >, < title > 
        <br/> < body >
        <br/> < /html </i>  
    <li>Add links using (a or a href="(add link adress here)"> (add link text here ) 
    <li>To move files into another directory in vs code, 
        simply click, drag and drop the file into the folder.
    </li>
     







    
    </li>  
   
   </ul>

   <h2> Advice to myself - </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Take your time! 
            <br/><i>Don't rush the process,
                let the information sink in before moving on. </i>
        </li>
        <li>Reproduce what you've been taught.
            <i>Try building something using the information you've just learned, 
                and than build again
                 (the repetition will help you remember what you've leaned)</i>
        </li>
        <li>Use your resources. <i> ( it's okay to return to the reading material and websites
             you've read in the past if you've forgotten how to do something. )</i></li>
    </ul>
